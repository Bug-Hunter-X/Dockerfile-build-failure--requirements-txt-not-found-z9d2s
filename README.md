This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles where the `requirements.txt` file is not found during the build process. This typically occurs due to incorrect file paths specified in the `COPY` instruction or because the `requirements.txt` file is not present in the expected location. The solution involves double-checking the file path and ensuring the `requirements.txt` file is present in the correct location.  This example shows how the error is resolved by ensuring that the requirements.txt file is copied correctly.
